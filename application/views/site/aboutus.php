	<span class="blueh2">Studygig makes studying simple</span>
	<p>Studygig enables students from any program to search for study material for any course.  Study materials can range from past tests, student notes, labs, lectures, outlines, research and pretty much anything that helps students study.  Students can then search and view these materials to help them study. 
		<br/><br/>
		Surveys we conducted amongst students in multiple Canadian universities have shown that students that studied off past tests and supplemental study material perform better than students that don’t.  It’s no wonder people are loving Studygig!  Studygig is currently only available for York University.  We will be expanding to other universities very soon, want us to come to your university?  Give us a shout! </p>
		
		<span class="blueh2">Public Alpha Release</span>
	<p>The Studygig Alpha release is the barebones of what Studygig will offer- it is our core features only (with some bugs and unfinished pages - we'll get to those very soon!).  We have many more features that will be added to the site as time progresses.  Our current to do list is composed of the following features:
		<ul class="guidelines" >
			<li>Study material classifieds</li>
			<li>Search filters</li>
			<li>Social connections</li>
		</ul>
		
		Studygig Beta will be launched mid-August 2011.</p>
	
	<span class="blueh2">The Future</span>
	<p>Our community is what determines what path we take in the future. We will closely follow user requests and suggestions and integrate features based on those requests. We hope to expand to other universities soon to help more students.</p>
	
	<span class="blueh2">Academic Integrity</span>
	<p>We at Studygig honor the Academic Integerity guidellines given by York University and ensure these rules are enforced on our site.  All user’s of Studygig must abide by the guidelines aswell.</p>
