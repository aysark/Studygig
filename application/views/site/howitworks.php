<h1>Three Easy Steps to Acing your Courses & Earning Rewards</h1>
<div class="col111">
	<h2>Step 1: Search</h2>
	<p>Searching for study material gives you access to a large database of user-submitted shared study material of uploads and a classifieds section of student-posted ads selling their study material.  With search results being university and course specific, this gives a wide range of content while still being relevant and consistent</p>
</div>
<div class="col222">
	<h2>Step 2: Download & Connect</h2>
	<p>Once you’ve searched you’ll be able to browse through uploaded study material or ads posted by students selling what you searched for.
		<br/><br/>
		You can then download the uploaded material using points (if you don’t have enough points see the next step!).  Or if you found an ad that your interested in, you can contact the seller to discuss more information and purchasing details.</p>

<div class="col333" >
	<h2>Step 3: Share & Sell</h2>
	<p>If you want to keep downloading study material you’ll need to earn points.  This is done by uploading your own study material for students to download.  The more study material you upload the more points you’ll earn! 
		
		<br/><br/>You can also sell your unused study material by posting an ad in the classifieds section.  This allows thousands of students to search for your study material and contact you if they are interested in purchasing.  You’ll be saving cash in no time!</p>
