	<h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
<p>Studygig considers it a privilege to help students achieve their academic objectives. We are passionate about advancing the aims of higher education. Therefore, it is a fundamental principle of Studygig that we maintain an unwavering commitment to the highest standards of academic integrity in everything we do.</p>
<span class="blueh2">Transparency is our commitment</span>
<p>
It is our desire to know and understand individual school policies so we can build and modify our service to achieve full compliance at each institution.  We encourage faculty to join our service. At Studygig, we believe that the involvement of professors is not only preferable, it is essential to ensuring the academic integrity of our services.</p>
<span class="blueh2">A 'level playing field'</span>
<p>
We believe that all students should compete on a "level playing field," and as such we provide equal access to study materials for all. Almost all universities have policies in place encouraging this type of equal opportunity.  
</p>
<span class="blueh2">Prohibited Material</span>
<p>
We do not condone or allow the distribution of prohibited materials (e.g., stolen exams, term papers, tests that have not been permanently returned, etc.). We will respond promptly and take corrective measures if we learn of any student activity that is not consistent with this commitment.
