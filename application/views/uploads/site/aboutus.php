	<span class="blueh2">Studygig makes studying simple</span>
	<p>Studygig enables students from any program to search for study material for any course.  Study materials can range from past tests, student notes, labs, lectures, outlines, research and pretty much anything that helps students study.  Students can then search and view these materials to help them study. 
		<br/><br/>
		Surveys we conducted amongst students in multiple Canadian universities have shown that students that studied off past tests and supplemental study material perform better than students that don’t.  It’s no wonder people are loving Studygig!  Studygig is currently only available for York University.  We will be expanding to other universities very soon, want us to come to your university?  <a href="contact">Give us a shout!</a> </p>
		
	
	<span class="blueh2">The Future</span>
	<p>Our community is what determines what path we take in the future. We will closely follow user requests and suggestions and integrate features based on those requests. We hope to expand to other universities soon to help more students.</p>
